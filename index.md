| We work with data from a variety of imaging instruments, such as 2D-S, 2DC, CIP, CPI, PIP, HVPS-3, HVPS-4, and others. | Our team won international competitions in satellite image analysis (e.g. [[1]](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/draper-satellite-image-chronology), [[2]](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/statoil-iceberg-classifier-challenge)) and helped our clients solve problems in different fields from agriculture and geology to weather prediction and city planning. | While our focus lies in image analysis primarily, we often get to work with accompanying data such as time series. Feel free to reach out for more information. |
